The TinkerDevice is a game where the player enters in visual keys that lead him down paths for puzzles and clues which tell a larger story about Rogue Hack Lab and TinkerFest.
	
Methods you can run from the console:
	hashMaker(); - Outputs the boolean array out that represents the current code that's entered. Good for creating a design, copying, and pasting into the answer key.
